Hello,

I find there 2 Errors:

- I can't save the offset (value) for the background pictures e.g. from Bing.
After saving, the old (wrong) offset appears. 
Please fix this error.

- Using the new version 2.4.1 it is not possible to disconnect for example 2 way.
The actual workaround is to delete the last part of the way!
In former this error often appears in older version, but the error was fixed automatically.
But now the old error appears again.
Please fix this error, too.

Thank you!
